In an age dominated by algorithm-driven social media platforms, there's a quiet renaissance happening in the corners of the internet: the return of the personal website, reimagined as a "digital garden."

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike traditional blogs with their chronological posts and polished presentations, digital gardens embrace a more organic approach to sharing ideas online. They're spaces where thoughts can be planted, cultivated, and grow over time—living documents rather than static publications.

    The term "digital garden" has been around since the late 1990s but gained significant traction in 2020 as people sought more meaningful ways to share ideas online during the pandemic.

Digital gardens reject the pressure of creating "finished" pieces. Instead, they celebrate the beauty of ideas in various stages of development:

- **Seeds**: Brief notes or questions that might develop into something more
- **Sprouts**: Early-stage ideas with some structure but still developing
- **Evergreens**: More mature, well-developed thoughts that have stood the test of time

## Why Gardens Instead of Feeds?

Social media feeds are designed for consumption, not contemplation. They're optimized for engagement metrics rather than deep thinking. The ephemeral nature of feeds means valuable ideas quickly disappear beneath the endless scroll.

Gardens, by contrast, are designed for exploration and serendipity. They invite visitors to wander, to discover unexpected connections, to return to ideas as they evolve. There's no algorithm deciding what you should see—just human curation and organic growth.

## Cultivating My Own Garden

This website is my attempt to embrace the digital garden philosophy. Here, I'm giving myself permission to:

1. **Publish imperfect ideas** - Sharing thoughts before they're fully formed
2. **Revisit and revise** - Treating published work as living documents
3. **Create non-linear pathways** - Connecting ideas across time and topics
4. **Prioritize value over virality** - Focusing on depth rather than reach

I'm particularly drawn to how digital gardens blur the line between consumption and creation. When we approach the web as gardeners rather than performers, we transform our relationship with our own ideas.

## The Technical Soil

The resurgence of digital gardens has been enabled by a new generation of tools that support networked thought. From Roam Research to Obsidian to custom static site generators, these tools emphasize connections between ideas rather than chronological ordering.

    This site is built with Jekyll, a static site generator that allows for flexible organization and linking between content while maintaining a lightweight, fast-loading experience.

For my garden, I've chosen a design that emphasizes:

- **Typography** - Making reading comfortable and enjoyable
- **Bidirectional links** - Creating a web of connected ideas
- **Progressive disclosure** - Allowing readers to dive as deep as they wish
- **Ambient persistence** - Making it easy to return to and build upon ideas

## An Invitation to Wander

If you've found your way here, I invite you to approach this space not as a blog to be read from newest to oldest, but as a garden to be explored at your leisure. Follow your curiosity. Double back to ideas that resonate. Watch as seeds grow into more developed thoughts.

And perhaps most importantly, consider planting a garden of your own. The web becomes more interesting, more human, and more thoughtful when we each tend our own plot of digital land.

As the internet continues to evolve, I believe these personal gardens—unique, idiosyncratic, and deeply human—will become increasingly valuable counterpoints to the homogenized experiences of social platforms.

Here's to growing ideas in the open, embracing the beauty of work in progress, and rediscovering the joy of a web built by individuals rather than algorithms.
