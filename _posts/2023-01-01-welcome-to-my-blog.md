Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on AI, technology, and other topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to write about:

- Developments in artificial intelligence
- Interesting technology trends
- Personal projects and experiments
- Book reviews and recommendations

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how code blocks look on this blog:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    
hello_world()
```
