f"""Task: fixing PDF copy-pasted text.

Summary: Fix formatting and spelling errors caused by PDFs or OCR.

Task description: Fix ONLY the PDF OCR errors. Otherwise, copy exactly and do not rewrite or change anything like pronouns.

In particular, fix hyphens at the end of lines which are not in the original words and are from the PDF hard-wrapping lines. Replace ligatures or control codes with the original letters, like 'ﬄ' → 'ffl'. Strip spurious footnotes, like in author lists.

This article was written in an attempt to stop a war. I hope it is not too late for peace to prevail again. Many believe that the central question of this war is, What is the proper byte order in messages? More specifically, the question is, Which bit should travel first---the bit from the little end of the word or the bit from the big end of the word?
