-- Experimental Pandoc module for fighting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_illusion> by
-- implementing automatic inflation adjustment of nominal date-stamped dollar or Bitcoin amounts to
-- provide real prices; Bitcoin's exchange rate has moved by multiple orders of magnitude over its
-- early years (rendering nominal amounts deeply unintuitive), and this is particularly critical in
-- any economics or technology discussion where a nominal price from 1950 is 11x the 2019 real
-- price! (Misunderstanding of inflation may be getting worse over time:
-- <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469008> )
-- Prior art: minimal. Most nominal amounts are never inflation-adjusted, and where they are, the author
-- usually settles for either replacing the number, using an ad hoc currency unit like '$2012', or
-- verbosely putting it in parentheses, like '$10 ($100 in 2019)'.
-- (My approach may have been inspired by the 2008 Wikipedia template: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Inflation>.)
--
-- Years/dates are specified in a variant of my interwiki link syntax (see Interwiki.hs); for example: '[$50]($2000)'
-- or '[₿0.5](₿2017-01-01)'.
-- As a backup syntax (eg. for use inside link anchor texts), one can write it as a span
-- like '[$50]{inflation=$2000)' (ie. `<span data-inflation="$2000">$50</span>`).
-- Dollar amounts use year, and Bitcoins use full dates, as the greater
-- temporal resolution is necessary. Inflation rates/exchange rates are specified in Inflation.hs
-- and need to be manually updated every once in a while; if out of date, the last available rate is
-- carried forward for future adjustments.
--
-- Dollar-years may range 1913–∞, although future years may be meaningless.
-- Dollars are inflation-adjusted using the CPI from 1913 to 1958, then the Personal Consumption
-- Expenditures (PCE) Index thereafter, which is recommended by the Federal Reserve and others as
-- more accurately reflecting consumer behavior & welfare than the CPI.
--
-- Bitcoins are exchange-rate-adjusted using a mix of Pizza Day, historical exchange rates, and
-- Poloniex daily dumps, and their dollar-equivalent inflation-adjusted to the current year. Rates
-- are linearly interpolated for missing in-between dates, and carried forwards/backwards when
-- outside of the provided dataset of daily exchange rates.
--
-- For discussion of other possible ways to adjust currency amounts or stocks, see <https://gwern.net/subscript#inflation>.
