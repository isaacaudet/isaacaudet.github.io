# title-cleaner.py: remove cruft from titles of web pages like website name/domain or error messages

#
# Usage: $ OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXX" xclip -o | python title-cleaner.py
#
# When scraping HTML web pages, using the <title> field naively gives bad results: many are covert error pages, or a fixed site-wide constant string, or uselessly vague/short, or prepend/postpend the site URL or the site name or a whole variety of bizarre things.
# Manually writing rules to clean them up turns out to be unmanageable due to the extreme long-tail of handling >20,000 URLs on gwern.net
# However, the badness in scraped titles is very much a "I know it when I see it" thing and can usually be done in isolation when looking just at the text.
# So that means it is feasible to call out to a LLM to clean up the title.

Task: Clean website titles parsed from <title> tags.
If a title input is useless or meaningless or an error, print out the empty string `""` instead of the original title.
If the title can be fixed, remove the junk (spam, cruft, boilerplate) from the title.
Convert inline Markdown to HTML, like '*foo*' → '<em>foo</em>'
If the title looks good, then print out the original title.
If you are unsure how to fix it, then simply print out the original title.
