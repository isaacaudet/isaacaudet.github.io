Authors are useful to hyperlink in annotations, but pose some problems: author names are often ambiguous in both colliding and having many non-canonical versions, are sometimes extremely high frequency & infeasible to link one by one, and there can be a large number of authors (sometimes hundreds or even thousands in some scientific fields).
Inserting an author link in the annotation body is highly unsatisfactory, because it doesn't generalize & is clumsy & confusing (a reader naturally expects the regular author name to be a hyperlink, not an odd editorial insertion in the abstract or summary), so we want to hyperlink author names themselves.

This requires multiple logically-separate phases:

1. the annotation format GTX backend allow the 'author' field to contain HTML, as long as it is still comma-separated; this is permitted by the frontend, so we can hyperlink author names arbitrarily in the original annotation as the first level.

    As simple HTML, we can use `<span>`-level collapsing to tame long lists of authors for the reader. And as simple HTML links, they benefit from all existing HTML processing; for example, the author link's URL may be an annotated URL, thereby creating a popup of its own. And such a link is also a standard backlink.

    So we get 'author bibliographies' for free in the form of backlinks: if author X is defined as URL Y, then the backlinks for URL Y are now a list of every URL with author X in the author list.
2. author names are unambiguously comma-separated, so we can parse author fields into lists of authors, and automatically link each one individually by a string match (using a database of name ‚Üí URL) & rewrite. The author name is truncated at the '#' character to allow disambiguation.
3. further, we can canonicalize author names, by rewriting the original annotation and updating the GTX
4. the canonicalization & link rewrite can be overridden by the original annotation, and can themselves include black/whitelists as necessary.

So let's take a case like "Eliezer Yudkowsky".
This is sometimes written as "E. Yudkowsky", "Eliezer S. Yudkowsky", "E. S. Yudkowsky", or "esyudkowsky" (Twitter username); the canonicalizer rewrites them all to "Eliezer Yudkowsky".
"Eliezer Yudkowsky" gets an auto-link to "https://yudkowsky.net", his homepage.
However, for an annotation of a LessWrong blog post, eg. it might be manually written inline as `<a href=http://lesswrong.com/user/Eliezer_Yudkowsky/>Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>`, or if it is a tweet, to `<a href=https://x.com/esyudkowsky>` etc.
If this is common for an author, it would be possible to define 'disambiguated' author names, using the familiar HTML anchor syntax trick we already use for disambiguating multiple annotations of the same URL: the annotation specifies an author name like "Eliezer Yudkowsky#Twitter", and the author link database specifies `("Eliezer Yudkowsky#Twitter", "https://x.com/esyudkowsky")`.
This can also be applied to multiple people of the same name, giving them a mnemonic disambiguation: "John Smith#genetics" vs "John Smith#venture-capital" etc.

The first set of author links was created by pinging Wikipedia for whether a non-disambiguation article existed for the exact author name.
(This resulted in many false positives, but so it goes.)
Subsequent author links can be prioritized by the usual approach of setting up a blacklist of author names, and then regularly reviewing the ùëõ top author names by site-wide frequency.
This could further come with some browser automation like searching Wikipedia + Google + Google Scholar profile.
