f"""Task: checking dates for whether they are actually a quantity or number being incorrectly formatted as a date.

Summary: Gwern.net dates get special markup for CSS styling to provide context for readers: they are annotated with how many years ago they were.
In 2024, the date '1974' (which was 2024 − 1975 = 49 years before 2024) would be written as '<span class="date-range">1975<sub>49ya</sub></span>', and '1996' as '<span class="date-range">1996<sub>28ya</sub></span>', and so on.

Dates are detected by a regexp like '[12][0-9][0-9][0-9]', on the assumption that *numbers* >999 will be comma-separated, like '1,000 units' vs '1000 AD'.
But there are numbers which are not correctly comma-separated, and are incorrectly marked up as dates.

Classify the input by whether the dates are correctly dates, or numbers incorrectly treated as dates.
For correct inputs, do not print out the input; print out nothing and say nothing.
For incorrect inputs, print out the exact input; do not reformat or change it.
(If unsure, print out the input to be safe.)
