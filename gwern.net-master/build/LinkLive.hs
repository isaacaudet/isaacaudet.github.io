Based on LinkIcon.hs. At compile-time, set the HTML class `link-live` on URLs from domains verified
to work (reasonably) well as cross-site popups inside a frame.
`extracts-contents.js` at runtime reads the class to decide which links will be live-popup-able.

Live popups are an alternative to, or a further step from, annotations. They let the reader preview
a link instantly. This is useful when an annotation is not available, or when the reader has read
the annotation and wants to go further.

However, due to the March of Web Progressâ„¢, many websites set X headers <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options>
or just plain don't work in a frame (often due to JS, and then often due to extremely reader-unfriendly design
like giant headers or stickies), or are 'mixed content' - that is, the HTTP (or HTTPS) version would work perfectly
*except browsers block it* in the name of security, so a reader who visits HTTPS Gwern.net can't load the HTTP version
and I have to test the HTTPS version instead, which even when it exists, will often be broken by things like
self-signed certificates etc.
Perhaps only a quarter of external links work as live popups.
So we can't just offer it as an option on all links, that will waste reader time & trust, and they will
learn to avoid the feature entirely and resent the visual clutter and trap of this 'feature'.

We instead whitelist domains based on manual testing using the list of links in /lorem#live-link-popups.
Since there are so many domains, we need a testsuite to keep track of what domains have been tested & found good,
tested & found bad, and testing is not done or ambiguous (due to practical issues like a test link having become
a local archive or 404 or changed domain entirely).

Finally, to keep up to date with new domains, each sync we rank domains by # of uses, and above a threshold,
automatically generate a live-link test-case appended to /lorem for manual review.
