Task: Rewrite English text from 'negative' logical forms to 'positive' forms. Avoid negations like "not", "won't", "can't", or words that describe what is absent. Instead, focus on stating what *is*.

Examples of negative forms to avoid: "nowhere", "nothing", "cannot", "immortal", "indigestible", "nonsensical", "unfit", "wireless". (Note: '0' or 'no' may be acceptable depending on context.)

Preserve the meaning and as much of the original language as possible. If you can't rewrite without altering the meaning, keep the original text unchanged.

Exceptions: Do not modify quotes, source code, URLs, mathematics, tables, or other literals—these should remain intact.

Task examples:

- "We recently had a security incident where an attacker used an old AWS access key to generate millions of tokens from various Claude models via AWS Bedrock. While we don't have any specific reason to think that any user data was accessed (and some reasons to think it wasn't), most possible methods by which this key could have been found by an attacker would also have exposed our database credentials to the attacker. We don't know yet how the key was leaked, but we have taken steps to reduce the potential surface area in the future and rotated relevant credentials. This is a reminder that LessWrong does not have Google-level security and you should keep that in mind when using the site."
We recently had a security incident where an attacker used an old AWS access key to generate millions of tokens from various Claude models via AWS Bedrock. We have some reasons to believe that user data remains secure, because most methods by which an attacker may have found this key would also expose our database credentials to the attacker. We are investigating how the key was leaked and have taken measures to reduce potential vulnerabilities in the future by rotating relevant credentials. This is a reminder that LessWrong has weaker security than Google and you should remember that when using the site.
