-- Statically, at site 'compile-time', define the link-icons for links. Doing this at runtime with CSS is
-- entirely possible and originally done by links.css, but the logic becomes increasingly convoluted
-- & bug-prone because of CSS properties like cascading & longest-matches, and exceptions like
-- 'organization icon overrides PDF icon' become fertile sources of errors & regressions.
-- links.css was replaced by links.js as an intermediate step, to document all of the rules & interactions.
-- links.js was then replaced by LinkIcon at compile-time.
-- Doing this at compile-time in Haskell is easier and also reduces performance burden on the client
-- browser. For a more detailed discussion of the problems & solution, and history of prior link-icon
-- implementations, see <https://gwern.net/design-graveyard#link-icon-css-regexps>.
--
-- We attempt to use as simple monochrome icons as possible to fit into the Gwern.net overall theme and reduce clutter & maintenance. We prefer typographical ones which can be inlined, will look familiar, and don't require a custom SVG (which would bloat the SVG sprite sheet). We prioritize domains by their frequency, and regularly review them; if a domain can't be given a good link icon, we add it to the review blacklist to ignore them. We try to avoid being overly clever: if it is not obvious to us what a link-icon should be, then that means having one is wrong! (Unless we want to make an exception, like because it is for site infrastructure, the reader may learn it quickly, or we just like it too much to not have a link-icon.)

-- Rules for URL ‚Üí icon. All supported examples: <https://gwern.net/lorem-link>
-- Supported icon types:
-- - "svg" (+$NAME of the SVG filename in </static/img/icons/$NAME>; must be dark-mode compatible);
-- - "text"+(1-4 Unicode characters) + comma-separated modifiers; text supports additional control:
--   - "sans" (given Gwern.net's default font is Source Serif Pro, it is serif by default, while many logotypes are deliberately sans so this enables Source Sans Pro),
--   - "mono" (IBM Plex),
--   - "italic" (serif italic weight),
--   - "overline",
--   - "tri" (for 3-letters, squeezing in horizontally),
--   - "quad" (turned into a 2√ó2 grid).
--  Most combinations will be valid so one can write "text,quad,mono" (eg. for a computing organization like 'IEEE'). Text effects beyond this can usually be achieved by some Unicode trickery, such as adding in HAIR SPACEs or using BOLD versions of characters. Emoji should also work with appropriate combining-characters but can be tricky to get working reliably cross-platform.
--
-- Rules: arbitrary pure Haskell can be used to match, and the order of rules matters to allow overrides/precedence (first rule to match wins, so higher=stronger); convenience helpers are provided to match a domain(s), anywhere(s) infix, or by extension(s). These also check for malformedness.
--
-- All rules MUST have a test-case exercising each sub-rule (if multiple domains are matched, each domain should have a test-case). Only one testcase is necessary in /lorem-link (because that's just testing that the link-icon itself looks right rendered by browsers, and not that said link-icon is being put on all the links it should be).
--
-- HTML/CSS implementation details:
-- Based on </static/js/links.js>. Text and SVG are styled as groups in </static/css/links.css>, and individual text-strings or SVGs can be styled individually (as is usually required).
-- The idea is to annotate every `<a>` with two new `data-` attributes, `data-link-icon` and
-- `data-link-icon-type` which jointly specify the type & content of the icon. The link-icon for
-- 'svg' type is overloaded to be a filename in `/static/img/icon/$LINKICON.svg`.
--
-- Œª linkIcon $ Link nullAttr [Str "foo"] ("https://forum.evageeks.org/forum?id=2222", "")
-- Link ("",[],[("link-icon","EG"),("link-icon-type","text")]) [Str "foo"] ("https://forum.evageeks.org/forum?id=2222","")
-- Œª linkIcon $ Link nullAttr [Str "foo"] ("/doc/foo.pdf", "Foo & Bar 2022")
-- ‚Üí Link ("",[],[("link-icon","pdf"),("link-icon-type","svg")]) [Str "foo"] ("/doc/foo.pdf","Foo & Bar 2022")
-- ‚Üí <a href="/doc/foo.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Foo &amp; Bar 2022">foo</a>
--
-- URL rewrite handling:
-- In cases of local archive links, matches on the `/doc/www/$DOMAIN/$ARCHIVE.html` aren't necessarily *exactly*
-- as powerful; local archives deliberately throw away sub-directory structure for simpler addresses, so 2 matches for
-- 'foo.com/bar/*' and 'foo.com/quux/*' would collide when trying to match just '/doc/www/foo.com/$ARCHIVE.html'.
-- For this case, we detect & exploit the `data-url-original` attribute which is around for just such problems,
-- and we run matches on the original URL, and everything should work as expected then.
