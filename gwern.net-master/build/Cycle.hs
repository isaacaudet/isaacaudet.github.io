-- *Which* rewrite rules are responsible for an infinite loop?
-- Here's one way to find bad nodes easily (albeit inefficiently):
-- start with the list of rewrites and two empty temporary lists;
-- from the rewrite list, take & incrementally add rules to the first list if they do not create a cycle in the first list;
-- if they do, add them to the second list instead (otherwise ignoring the second list);
-- when all rules are used up, return the second list. Those are the bad rules.
